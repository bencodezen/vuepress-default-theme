# VuePress Default Theme

The default VuePress theme is incredible. That said, the only way to get access to it and modify it is to eject from the default theme, but this is terrifying considering the message clearly warns you:

> Once you eject, you are on your own and won't be receiving future updates or bug fixes to the default theme even if you upgrade VuePress.

So this repo was created to give people a chance to take the default theme and customize it.

## Roadmap

1. Produce a CSS compliant formatted version (i.e., none of the weird Stylus no brackets / semi-colons business)
1. Refactor the CSS architecture because the specificity on this is all over the place and it makes it hard to make quick customizations to the theme
